**Steam Game Recommendation and EDA Project**

**Motivation**

This project aims to build a game recommendation system and perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on user recommendations from the Steam Store. I am interested in understanding user behavior and identifying the key factors that influence game recommendations.

**Data Source**

The dataset used is "Game Recommendations on Steam" from Kaggle. It contains over 41 million cleaned and preprocessed user recommendations, along with detailed information about games and add-ons. The dataset comprises three main files:

games.csv: Contains game information such as ratings, pricing, and release dates.
users.csv: Contains public user profile information.
recommendations.csv: Contains user reviews indicating whether a game is recommended.

**Data Analysis**

The project will involve:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Examining distributions of ratings, pricing, and user activity, and visualizing key trends.
Machine Learning Techniques: Developing and evaluating a recommendation model based on user preferences and game features.

**Findings**

Expected findings include:

Identification of significant factors that drive user recommendations.
Insights into trends in game ratings, pricing, and user engagement.
Clustering of similar games based on analyzed features.

**Limitations and Future Work**
Limitations: Since the dataset is already preprocessed, certain nuances of the raw data might be lost.
Future Work: Enhancing the recommendation model, integrating additional data sources, and exploring advanced ML techniques for further improvements.
